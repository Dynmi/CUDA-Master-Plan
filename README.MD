## How to master cuda programming in one week?

I think the SOTA approach can be divided into three levels:
- Level 1: You get to know what is cuda, and be able to use cuda in a **NAIVE** way to accelerate your computation.
- Level 2: You are **PROFICIENT** to use all kind of techniques to optimize the naive cuda programming, such as shared memories, ILP.
- Level 3: You can **FLUENTLY** use cuda in your project to do whatever you want without restraint. For example, use cuda in a nerual network project.
